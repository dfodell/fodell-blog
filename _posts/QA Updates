This week has been crazy; it feels like I'm an octopus, and someone is pulling every arm in a different direction.

Starting with normal SVS duties, we have been introducing a lot of new, big features that have had some
problems getting through QA. Our last scheduled release before the regular season begins is on Monday the 27th,
and we still have sub-tasks getting worked on today March 23rd. I am not optimistic about that feature getting
in the release, and it's a feature that we promised clients.

Squish and automated testing also has me stressed out. Jake has made it abundantly clear that we either get
it working or we're heading out the door. While I understand why, it's still incredibly stressful to be told
that your job is on the line dealing with a new task that you barely know how to log in to.

I was really hoping to have time to work more on my Granular Data plan too. Even though it's probably never
going to happen, I really feel that if we don't get more complex with our data we're sunk. I already found out that
x-info reporters are going to collect less data points this year, which seemed like a huge draw for clients. I'm
not sure what that is all about, but hopefully I'm missing something behind the scenes (like we're still going to
collect the data, but not with out reporters).

And even though it has nothing to do with work, the 3-on-3 draft has been going on this week, and that's stressing
me out. Part of that whole deal is figuring out who everyone is, and trying to get some sort of strategy together involving
people I've never met.
